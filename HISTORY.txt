SilvaViews changes

  0.13

    Modified class registration for new Silva 2.1
    product registration, using a zmi-add-list filter.  SilvaViews
    will still function if Silva is not present

  0.11

    The improvement in 0.10 created problems inside Silva
    itself. Reverted this to older situation.

  0.10

    Changed way SilvaViews find the right view pages. There is now less
    chance an object in content space will have an id clash with a 
    view.
 
  0.9
  
    Initial public release.
